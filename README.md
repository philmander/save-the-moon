# Save The Moon

An old Java game of mine resurrected in Typescript.

I originaly built this game for a university graphics module
in 2004. I found the Java source code printed out in an old
folder and wrote it up in Typescript + Canvas API.

Despite 14 years, different platforms and different languages, the 
source code isn't that different to the original.

## Set up

`npm i`

Open `dist/index.htm1` in a browser.
