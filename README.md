# Save The Moon

An old Java applet game of mine resurrected in Typescript + Canvas API 

https://philmander.github.io/save-the-moon/dist/index.html

I originaly built this game for a university graphics module
in 2004. I recenlty found the source code printed out in an old
folder and, for the nostalgia, wrote it up in Typescript + Canvas API.

Despite 14 years, a single thread, different platforms and different languages, the 
source code isn't that different to the original.

## Set up

`npm i`

Open `dist/index.htm1` in a browser.
